Virtual Town
Overview

Virtual Town is an interactive web application that simulates a virtual town with buildings like gyms, restaurants, hospitals, mechanics, and more. Each building allows users to interact with virtual characters powered by AI. The goal is to provide an engaging, real-life-like experience where users can select a building, meet the greeters, and continue dynamic conversations using AI APIs like OpenAI, Google AI, or others.
Features

    Interactive Virtual Town: Explore a town with clickable buildings that represent various real-world establishments.
    AI-Powered Conversations: Once a building is clicked, the user interacts with characters via AI-generated dialogue. Characters respond as if you were speaking to them in real life.
    Custom AI Selection (Future Enhancement): Select different AI models (Google, OpenAI, etc.) to power interactions.
    Modular Design: The project is structured for scalability, allowing more buildings and services to be added easily.

Getting Started
Prerequisites

To run this project locally, ensure you have the following installed:

    Node.js (v12.x or higher)
    npm

Installation

    Clone the repository:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/virtual-town.git

Navigate into the project directory:

bash

cd virtual-town

Install the necessary dependencies:

bash

    npm install

Running the Project

    Start the development server:

    bash

npm start

Open your web browser and navigate to:

arduino

    http://localhost:3000

You should now see the virtual town with clickable buildings. Clicking on a building opens a modal with AI-generated dialogue (simulated for now).
Usage

    Click on any building in the virtual town to open an interaction modal.
    The AI character will introduce themselves based on the building you’ve selected (e.g., a gym trainer, restaurant server, etc.).
    Future enhancements will allow more detailed conversations and dynamic responses from the AI.

Future Enhancements

    Real AI API Integration: Connect to actual AI services like OpenAI or Google AI to handle user interactions dynamically.
    User Authentication: Add user authentication to allow personalized interactions and save conversation history.
    More Buildings: Expand the town with more locations and diverse interactions.
    Custom AI Selection: Provide users with the ability to select different AI models or APIs for personalized interactions.
    Mobile Responsiveness: Make the site fully responsive for mobile and tablet devices.
